There they go—packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go—Macadamian—they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow—fuck no!
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over—oh, no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
